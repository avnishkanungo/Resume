## PROJECTS

### **AudioNLToSQL: Running SQL queries using voice commands and text**  
*June 2024 – July 2024*  

- Created a system combining an Automatic Speech Recognition Model and a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 to convert voice and text commands to SQL queries, with automation for running the query on a hosted MySQL database.
- Utilized OpenAI Models, Hugging Face Library, Langchain, Pytorch, SQL, and SQLAlchemy for implementation.

### **Hyper-Parameter Tuned DDPG Implementation on Robotic Arm**  
*Jan 2024 - Feb 2024*  

- Implemented Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) from scratch using Pytorch for FetchReach-V2 robotic environment with hyperparameter tuning using Optuna. Achieved a 91% success rate after 5000 training episodes.

### **Semantic Segmentation for Image Representation and Classification**  
*March 2024 - April 2024*  

- Implemented semantic segmentation using the u-net architecture on the MS COCO dataset with Pytorch, evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss, Dice Loss, and a combined Dice-MSE Loss.

### **Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Malware Classification using Deep Learning Techniques**  
*Aug 2024 – Sept 2024*  

- Developed an IDS based on LSTM-CNN network using the UNSW-NB15 Malware Dataset with Tensorflow and scikit-learn. Achieved 93.5% accuracy, an F1 score of 0.907, and an AUC of 0.89.
